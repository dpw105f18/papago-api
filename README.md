# papago-api
This repository contains the implemention of the papago graphics API, which builds on top of the Vulkan API by Khronos Group.
It is being developed by group dpw105f18 at Aalborg University as part of our master thesis.
Information about the use of the Papago API can be seen on the github wiki.

## Test
The testing solution found in [papago-api-test](../blob/master/papago-api-test) is using the [Google's C++ testing framework](https://github.com/google/googletest).
To run the tests in Visual Studio you need to install the [GoogleTestAdapter](https://www.nuget.org/packages/GoogleTestAdapter/) nuget package.
